    <h1 id = "QIP">QIP: Switching of Eye Drops</h1>
    <h2><span>Objectives</span></h2>
        <p>
            To review and switch all adult patients with dry eyes to Eyeaze 0.1% or 0.2% who are prescribed the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>Hylo-Tear 0.1% eye drops</li>
                <li>Hy-Opti 0.1% eye drops</li>
                <li>Xailin Tears HA 0.1% eye drops</li>
                <li>Hylo-Forte 0.2% eye drops</li>
                <li>Hy-Opti 0.2% eye drops</li>
                <li>Clintas Multi 0.2% eye drops</li>
                <li>Evolve HA 0.2% eye drops</li>
                <li>Xailin Plus HA 0.2% eye drops</li>
                <li>HydraMed 0.2% eye drops</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Switch applies to 0.1% and 0.2% strengths of the branded generics available. Switching Sodium Hyaluronate 0.15% eye drops, however, remains the prescriber's clinical decision to switch to either 0.1% or 0.2% product, if clinically appropriate to do so.</p>
    <h2><span>Background</span></h2>
        <p>For patients who have a diagnosis of dry eyes, Sodium Hyaluronate eye drops, also known as artificial tears, are prescribed. The eye drops are used to relieve dry eyes and soreness, lubricating the surface of the eye to increase comfort.</p>
        <p>As per <a href = "https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/dry-eye-syndrome/management/management/" target = "_blank">NICE CKS guidance,</a> a prescription for treatment of dry or sore eyes should not routinely be offered in primary care as the condition is appropriate for self-care.</p>
	<p>
 Patients should be encouraged to manage both dry eyes and sore eyes by implementing some self-care measures such as good eyelid hygiene and avoidance of environmental factors alongside treatment Mild to moderate cases of dry eye syndrome or sore tired eyes can usually be treated using lubricant eye treatments that consist of a range of drops, gels and ointments that can be easily be purchased over the counter</p>
    <h2><span>Cost</span></h2>
        <p>Eyeaze has a <strong>lower acquisition cost</strong> than other generic and branded equivalents; switching all patients across NW London primary care to this preferred branded generic could potentially save an estimated <strong>£280,000.</strong></p>
        <p>Below is a cost comparison of Eyeaze to other currently prescribed eye drops for a 10ml quantity:</p>
        <ul>
